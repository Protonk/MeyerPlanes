Cal. Aero Club.  At that meeting, the 25 interested men formed instead the ACC.  The ACC's purpose was to obtain grounds for experimental ascents and maintain construction and repair shops.  In Nov. 1909, it was described as seeking to boost the science of aeronautics and to invent and build aeroplanes.  By-laws were adopted in 1909 and 1911; articles of incorporation adopted 2 Apr. 1910 were filed on 14 May 1910.

In the 1917 annual, only the ASC is listed; we know nothing that suggests an ACC-ASC merger.  (In January 1910, the ACC had proposed to form a state federation in which it, Pacific AC, and AC of Oakland, would each become branches; the Aeronautical Squad of the Cal. Nat'l  Guard would become the military branch; and the Cal. Aviation Soc. would be absorbed.)

Johnson, and W. A. Hall, were then building aeroplanes, while R. M. Dunghan had completed plans for a balloon.

A second international meet was held 24 Dec.1910-3 Jan. 1911.","An auxillary club consisting of 30 students at the Polytechnic High School was established in December 1908.  Financing for the January 1910 aviation meet was provided by the California Aviation Society (CAS), an entity formed by Dick Ferris in November 1909 for that purpose.  CAS president, Henry E. Huntington, donated $50,000, an amount said matched by the people of LA; $80,000 in prizes was distributed.  The CAS had hopes that the ACA would accept its affiliation over that of the ACC but was informed that could not happen due to the priority of the application from the ACC.

That July, some LA businessmen incorporated the Aeronautical Society of California (ASC) as a general aeroplane business.  It's president was the millionaire Earle Remington.  The ACC was to provide contest rules and technical work for an aviation meet proposed to be held in LA around Thanksgiving 1911 while the ASC was to attend to business and financial needs.

At the Park of Coteaux de Saint Cloud, there was material for the inflation of balloons, a special gas intake, a vast shed capable of housing fully inflated balloons, grounds for the starting of ten balloons, an automobile garage, a lounging room for club members, tennis courts, croquet grounds, and a park open the entire year.

The Aero Club of Pennsylvania (ACP) counts December 1909 as when it was organized although it was on 10 Jan. 1910 that rules were adopted, officers elected, and jurisdiction assumed in Pennsylvania through the ACA.  Incorporation in Pennsylvania was 13 May 1910.  By 1 Apr. 1910, the club owned a Bleriot and a Curtiss machine.  By the end of 1910, three leading balloon groups in Philadelphia --  Aero Club of Philadelphia, Ben Franklin Aeronautical Society, and Philadelphia Aeronautical Recreational Society (which see) -- had merged with the ACP.  Flying, published Jan. 1912-July 1921, was the official publicaton of the ACA, the ACP, and others.   Aeronautics, published in NY, was the official publication of the ACP in 1914.  The Historical Society of PA has ACP records including a minutebook that covers 1909-1953.  ","Initial officers included Arthur T. Atherholt, pres.; R. H. Beaumont and Louis J. Bergdoll, VPs; Jack Hiscock, sec.; and Laurence Maresh, treas.  Atherholt was reelected 20 Jan. 1911.  175 members in June 1910.  Through the efforts of club member Henry M. Neely, the then largest aviation exhibition ever held in the USA. ran at the Phila. Armory 3-10 Nov. 1910; 30,000 spectators attended the air show at Point Breeze Race Track in the city's Driving Park.  In 1912, the club established Eagle Field in the town of Manoa, 3 miles west of Phila.  In the club's first decade, Robert Glendinning and other club enthusiasts were instrumental in establishing the Phila. School of Aviation to train pilots in techniques of water operation.  The Essington Seaplane facility on the banks of the Delaware River south of the Phila.Navy Yard, where the school was located, was one of 4 such sites in the nation when the USA entered WW1 in 1917.  Although having jurisdiciton in PA for FAI-sanctioned events, the membership appears to have always been drawn from the Delaware Valley and not the entire Commonwealth.   ","The ACP claims that the Ben Franklin Balloon Association (BFBA) had also merged with it by the end of 1910, but our research indicates that the BFBA was a close corporation, apparently assembled to handle the purchase of a balloon for the Ben Franklin Aeronautical Society, which see.   The April 1910 issue of Aircraft says the ACP's constitution and bylaws were adoped on 17 Dec. 1909 and on the 18th, the application for charter was prepared.  While 17 Dec. 1909 appears to be the first meeting, we do not have another source that says the constitution, by-laws, and application for charter were prepared in December.

By 5 Jan. 1907, 30 charter members had been identified and Louis D. ""Bud"" Dozier headed a 5-person organizing committee.  Officers elected 16 Jan. included Dozier, pres.; David H. Francis, Dan C. Nugent, and G H. Walker, VPs; Francis D. Hirschberg, treas., and John W. Kearney, sec.  By March 1907, 300 members were reported.  Nearly 100,000 packed an area around the club's grounds on 21 Oct. 1907 to watch the start of the Gordon Bennett race (won by the German balloon ""Pomern."")  The club's incorporation was said to be 27 May 1908.  At a reorganization on 11 June 1908, the original officers were reelected.            "," In 1908, it was reported to be one of the first four affiliates of the ACA.  On 23 Apr. 1910, the Aero Club of St. Louis renounced its affiliation with the Aero Club of America (ACA) because the ACA made agreements with the Wright brothers to not exhibit machines that the Wrights alleged infringed on their patents.  The agreements made it impossible for any city to hold an aviation meet under sanction of the Aero Club of America without a license from the Wrighs.  The St. Louis club was represented at a meeting 23 May 1910 at the headquarters of the ACA of other aero clubs who, opposed to this policy, organized the American Aeronautical Association (AAA), which see; A. B. Lambert of the St. Louis club became its temporary 1st VP.  The AAA, however, lasted until only 22 June 1910 when the American Aeronautical Federation (AAF), which see, was formed.  The St. Louis club did not join the AAF and instead joined in forming the National Council of Affiliated Clubs of the ACA on 23 June, which see, for which Lambert was elected a temporary vice chairman.        ","Three women accompanied pilot H. Eugene Honeywell in the first ascent of the St. Louis Aero Club's new balloon, ""Missouri,"" on 17 July 1909.  The flight of the three women, who were the first to ascend in St. Louis, was hurriedly arranged after it was learned that a woman, Miss Julia Hoerner, was to go up on 18 June in the balloon of the rival South St. Louis Aero Club.  Hoerner, however, was made a member of the South St. Louis Aero Club on 17 July 1909.  The first balloon ascensions from new grounds at Choteau and Taylor Avenues occurred on 1 Aug. 1909.  On 3 Feb. 1910, Dozier (who had still never been up in a balloon) was elected president again and Albert Bond Lamber was elected first vice president.  The club organized the St. Louis National Aero Show, 8-13 Oct. 1910, which included aeroplane and balloon events and an aeroplane exhibition, 5-15 Oct. 1910; ex-U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt was among the attendees.

The Yacht Club members included some 30 who were also members of the Aero Club of America and it appears that at least some 20 of those were the nucleus af an aero club within the yacht club.  While we can locate a reference in the New York Times of 13 Jan. 1910 to the 20 members forming an aero club, it appears that aero club activities were already underway in the summer of 1909 when yacht club members built a flying machine behind St. Lawrence Park.  More building was supposed to take place in the summer of 1910.      ","Dr. J. Miles Gibbons is credited with forming an aero Club of the St. Lawrence River in the summer of 1909.  We believe that this was the division of the Thousand Islands Yacht Club that became formally known as the Areo Club of the Thousand  Islands by April 1910.  At the annual mid-winter dinner of the Thousand Islands Yacht Club on 14 Jan. 1910, a syndicate within the club exhibited an aeroplane, yet without its motor, that they had commissioned an unidentified German aviator to build.  Members of the syndicate, identified at various times in 1910, included Dr. Gibbons and Alfred G. Miles, both of New York City; L. N. Rumsey of St. Louis;  C. L. Hayden of Columbus, Ohio; Frederick K. Burnham, address not identified; and Price McKenney, Morrisburg, Ontario.

The ACA-Wright agreements made it impossible for any city to hold an aviation meet under ACA sanction without a license from the Wrights.  The AAA was to meet again on 22 June to form a permanent organization.  On 2 June 1910 at a meeting at the Aeronautic Society of different dissidents, some 39 aero clubs formed the Aeronautic Federation of America and planned to meet jointly with the AAA on 23 June to form one permanent organization after both had met separately on 22 June.  However, the AFA took over the 22 June meeting of the AAA and at an evening session, 36 clubs walked out.

After this day meeting, a number of the attendees went to dinner with a member of the Aero Club of Amerrica (its Board of Governors had also met that day) and at dinner the idea of forming an ACA national council was proposed.  Upon convening their meeting in the evening, some half of the AAA-AFA delegates walked out.  Those who exited met at the ACA and perfected a temporary organization, made permanent on 23 June, the National Council of Affiliated Clubs of the ACA (which see).  Made permanent on 23 June, the NC gained supreme charge of aviation meets in the US and the ACA retained its representation in the IFA and the right to hold international meets in the US, thus keeping powers it had feared losing to a new organization.

The ACA-Wright agreements made it impossible for any city to hold an aviation meet under ACA sanction without a license from the Wrights.  While news reports called the new group the Ametican Aeronautic Association, its correspondence used American Aeronautical Association.  The number of clubs appears to have fluctuated: on 2 June, there were said to be 12;  on 17 June, there were said to be 10.  Officers elected 23 May were to serve until 22 June when the AAA would meet.  On 2 June 1910 at a meeting at different dissidents, some 39 aero clubs formed the Aeronautic Federation of America and planned to meet jointly with the AAA on 23 June to form one permanent group after both had met separately on 22 June.  However, the AFA took over the 22 June meeting of the AAA and that evening session, 36 clubs walked out.  Those who exited perfected what became the National Council of the ACA.  Ten of those remaining fomed the American Aeronautical Federation. ","Temporary officers elected on 23 May 1910 to serve until 22 June 1910 included George M. Meyers, Kansas City Aero Club, president; A. B. Lambert, St. Louis Aero Club, 1st vice president; J. V. Martin, Harvard Aeronautical Society, 2nd vice president; Victor Lougheed, Aero Club of Illinois, secretary; and Jerome H. Joyce, Aero Club of Baltimore, treasurer.   By 18 June, the American Aeronautic Association represented 10 aero clubs, including those of St. Louis, Kansas City, Peoria, Indiana, Illinois, Harvard University, Buffalo, Balitmore, and Colorado. ","In the contemporary news, both the names ""American Aeronautic Association"" and ""American Aeronautical Association"" appear.  Our research suggests American Aeronautic Association was used more frequently; however, the correct name appears to be ""The American Aeronautical Association.""  A 23 May 10 letter to the ACA, informing it of the new organization, is signed ""The American Aeronautical Association, per Victor Lougheed, Secretary.  [The letter is reprinted in the SLPD, 24 May 1910 and at 7 Aeronautics 20 (July, 1910).]  Also, the U.S- Air Force Academy Library holds a ""Rough draft of proposed Constitution and By-Laws for the consideration of the organization and convention committee of the Aeronautic Federation of America and the American Aeronautical Association, to be presented and acted upon at the convention of June 22, 1910 . . .

Upon convening again, over half the delegates walked out.  Those who exited met at the Aero Club of America and perfected what became the National Council of the Aero Club of America.  Those who remained were said to include delegates of 12 clubs, 10 of which formed the American Aeronautical Federation (AAF), the name already selected had the AFA and AAA merged as expected.  Officers were elected and a constitution adopted.  The Aeronautical Society offered the courtesy of its grounds at Garden City to all desirous of qualifying for pilot's licenses of the AAF.  On 24 June, the AAF mailed a brief to ""every"" club and society in the US discussing the events of 22 June and its formation and criticizing the National Council.  After that, the AAF seems unreported upon as an organization and it appears that at least some of its members later became affiliates of the ACA.        ","Officers elected 22 June, according to news reports on 23 June, were:  Hudson Maxim (New York, NY), president; L. J. Sealy (Rochester Aero Club), George W. Clark (Jacksonville Aero Club). Dr. Thomas E. Eldrige (Aero Club of Philadelphia), Wilbur R. Kimball (Aeronautical Society), Oscar J. Needham (Aero Club of Dayton); J. C. Eberhardt (Dayton Aeroplane Club), vice presidents; Thomas A. Hill (New York, NY), secretary; Dr. R. C. Northwood (West Side YMCA), treasurer; and Lee S. Burridge, supervisor.  The Aero Clubs of Amherst College and Springfield, Massachusetts were reported as the two of the 12 remaining clubs who had dropped out.  However, the 10 clubs named in 23 June and later news reports --  the Aero Clubs of Jacksonville (Florida), Philadelphia, Rochester, West Side (NY) YMCA (as a junior club, it is not in this table), and Canada, as well as the Aeronautical Society of New York, the Aeronautique [or Aeronautic] Society of New Jersey, the Philadelphia Aeronautical Recreation Society; the (West Side) YMCA Alumni Aeronautic Aeronautic Club, and the Southern Aero Club -- did not include the two Dayton Clubs whose representatives had been elected as officers; they, too, went on to withdraw their credentials the evening of 22 June.  ","It appears that when the officers were elected on 22 June, their clubs were identified as still remaining in the American Aeronautical Association.  It was only after the constitution and by-laws were adopted that the new organization became the American Aeronautical Federation.  When listing the new officers in its August 1910 issue, Aeronautics did not not name the officers from Dayton but it did call the new organization the Aeronautic Federation of America.  We are certain that the correct name was ""The American Aeronautical Federation,"" for the National Air and Space Museum has in its archives from the William J. Hammer Collection a copy of the constitution and by-laws of The American Aeronautical Federation dated 22 June 1910.   ",

The dinner, a rousing affair, was a send-off in honor of Edward H. Thompson, a Baltimore banker, who had accepted a dare of Philadelphia aeronaut Arthur T. Atherholt some months ago to go ballooning.  The balloon flight, which was to take place on 30 May, drew an audience of thousands but the flight itself was a failure; the gas was inadequate and when the bag was wrestled to the ground it was torn.  While said club members met again that evening and reportedly discussed plans for a real ascension, no information has been found on later activities of the club.  ","E. H. Thomson was elected president of the Baltimore Aero Club at its organizational meeting on 29 May 1908.

Said Baltimore Aero Club appears to have no connection to the Aero Club of Baltimore formed 30 Sept. 1909.           ","There was another club in Baltimore known as the Aero Club that at its inception had nothing to do with aerial navigation.  It was founded by three employees of the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone company and another friend in February 1909 who were interested in wireless communication and wanted to advance the message that any one will skill and patience could buy the materials and make a machine capable of sending messages for miles.

Sponsored Russia's first major aeronautical event, the ""First International Week of Aviation,"" in April 1910, patterning it after events held in Germany, and from 8 Sept.-1 Oct., 1910, held the first ""All-Russian Festival of Aeronautics,"" at the recently completed Komendantskoe Aerodrome in St. Petersburg.  Approximately 140,000 tickets were sold to the latter with the vast majority, some 104,000, purchased by those of more modest means.","On 18 June 1909, Count Chamberlin Palitsin was killed, his wife fatally injured, and two other persons severely injured in an accident involving the Army balloon General Wannowski.  The injured were the pilot, Captain Korbee, and Count Rostofftseff.  Except for Korbee, all were inexperienced members of the St. Petersburg club.  The accident was caused when the Count mistakenly pulled the rip cord.  As the gas escaped from the envelope, the balloon dropped to the ground.","Still to resolve is whether I list as a separate entity before Imperial became part of the name.  If not, which name should be listed first.  This is a problem with more than just Russia."

Objectives of the club were to own, control, and manufacture balloons, aeroplanes, and aircraft of every description; to promote the science of aeronautcs; to meet in competitions; and to encourage and promote the ideals of navigation of the air.  Officers and directors were elected at a meeting of the incorporators 6 Mar. 1908 in rooms of the Merchants' and Manufacturers' Association.  A committee was appointed at that time to formulate bylaws.  The state fair park at West Allis was to be the balloon grounds of the club.  (According to the New York Times of 10 Apr.1908, the club was one of the first four affiliates of the Aero Club of America; however, given information in the ACA annuals 1909 and 1910, this appears to be an incorrect statement.  Instead, it appears that the fourth was the Aero Club of North Adams, Massachusetts.)  ","Initial officers, 1908, were elected from the 17 incorporators and included John H. Moss, president; John H. Kopmeier and Edward P. Vilas, vice presidents; Richard B. Watrous, secretary; Oliver C. Fuller, treasurer.  In July 1908, Col. Gustav Pabst gave the club a balloon so Maj. Henry B. Hersey (an incorporator and board member), considered a leading balloon pilot in the USA, could instruct Milwaukee men in the handling of balloons sufficient to obtain their licenses from the Aero Club of America.  Officers, 1911, included William G. Bruce, president; John H. Kopmeier and A. O. Smith, vice presidents; Frank A. Cannon, secretary; and Gladstone Cherry, treasurer.  The Milwaukee Aero Club was invited to enter a balloon in the August 1910 Harvard-Boston meet.   ","One of the incorporators was Ruldolph A.

Made permanent the next day as the National Council of the Aero Club of America, it immediately gained supreme charge of aviation meets and records in the US and the ACA retained its representation in the IFA and the right to hold international meets in the US, thus ending prospects for the same by the new Aeronautic Federation of America, which see.

(A back story of the formation of the NC is that after the delegates of the Aeronautic Federation of America were finally seated at the meeting of the American Aeronautic Association on 22 June, a break was called.  A number of delegates went to dinner with a member of the ACA (its Board of Governors had also met that day) and at dinner the idea of forming an ACA national council was proposed.  Upon convening of the meeting that evening, over half of the delegates walked out.

Members were said to include capitalists, professional men, mechanics, scholars, and dilettantes.   At least in the beginning, the club met weekly; its meeting place was the boardroom of Crocker National Bank.

Great Britain's first aviation government office, the Department of Air Ministry, came about because of the insistence of the Royal Aero Club.

Fielding, an accomplished automobile and motor boat enthusiast, was having H. E. Honeywell of St. Louis build a 70,000 cubic-foot balloon for him to race.  On its first flight, the Fielding-San Antonio balloon, piloted by Honeywell and with Fielding on his first ascent, won the 3-6 July 2008 Chicago to Atlantic Ocean balloon race (Chicago to Ocean Race) sponsored by the Aeronautique Club of Chicago.  According to newspaper accounts, the balloon represented the Aero Club of Texas, which we now think were references to the San Antonio Aero Club of Texas, also known as the San Antonio Aero Club.

[There is more info from L'Aeronauta but need translation.]  The Almanacco Italiano for 1898 tells us that a committee was formed in Milan on 15 Aug, 1897 to promote the establishment of a Societa Aeronautica Italiana.  Acceptances poured in to the offices of L'Aeronauta and at a meeting of the promoters on 27 September, the Society was founded at Milan. ","Present for the vote on 27 Sept. 1897 were the Society's main promoters, Count Almerico da Schio, Sig. Bollini, Ten. Castagneris, Ing. Fontana, Ing. Possi, Ten. Vilardi, and the industrialist Alfonso Negri.  Others named as involved included military officers, doctors, professors, and engineers.  It appears that formal elections ended up being postponed at this and subsequent meetings until February 1898 when Sig. Vialarde, director of L'Aeronauta, was named temporary president by vote of a management committee of the society's organizers.  ","1910 Brockett 783 identified the 1897 Societa Aeronautica Italiana as the Milan section of the Societa Aeronautica Italiana, founded at Rome in 1904, based on an article in the August-September 1897 issue of L'Aeronauta about the Societa Aeronautica Italiana formed in Milan in 1897.  Our research shows that the Milan section of the 1904 Society was established in 1905 or 1906 and we have not yet found any information that the SAI Sezione Milano derived from the 1897 society.

From the beginning, it appears the SAI functioned as a local organization in Rome and as a national organization for Italy.  In 1905, sections were formed in Turin (SAI Sezione di Torino) and Milan (SAI Sezione di Milano) and by then the local effort in Rome was known as the SAI Sezione di Roma.  Both the sede central (headquarters) and the Rome section shared the same address.  According to its 1906 statutes, the SAI consisted of founding members and in autonomous sections based in Rome and other cities of Italy (though none were named), with a central department (Direzione Centrale or DC) resident at the headquarters (Sede Social) in Rome.  The president of the Rome section served as the general president of the SAI who, along with delegates from each section, comprised the DC.  In 1909, there appear to have been new bylaws and the DC was renamed the Consiglio General (CG) or General Council.  The CG included delegates from the SAI, the Societa Italiana d'Aviazione (SIA), the Touring Club Italiano, and the Automobile Club d'Italia. ","The SAI's purposes included favoring aeronautics in all its forms and applications, contrbuting to the science and the sport of aeronautics, publishing a bulletin, and fostering the use and study of racing pigeons as an aid to aeronautics. In 1906, the SAI existed under the patronage of H.R.H. Victor Emmanuel, King of Italy, and the honorary presidency of H.R.H. Prince Luigi Amedeo of Savoy, Duke of Abruzzi.  Dr. Filippo De Fillippi was the general president ca. 1906.  In 1910, the patron and honorary president were the same, Potenziana P.pe Lodovico was president, and Capt. Guido Castagneris was general secretary.  The official organ published 1904 through 1908 was Bollettino della Societa Aeronautica Italiana (Vols. 1-5).  That was succeeded in 1909 by Revista Tecnica di Aeronautica e Bollettino della Societa Aeronautica Italiana (Vol. 6).  Beginning in 1910, the publication's title was shortened to Revista Technica d'Aeronautica (Vol. 7).  In 1911, the Societa Aeronautica Italiana was reformed as the Aero Club d'Italia, which see, with affiliates at Rome, Turin, and Milan.  The SAI Sezione di Roma became the Aero Club di Roma, which see.       ","The ""Regolamento per la Coppa Aeronautica 'Regina Marherita di Savoia per il passaggio delle Alpi in aerosato,"" published by the SAI, apparently in 1906, is the earliest reference we have found to the SAI Direzione Centrale in Rome as well as to sections in Rome, Turin, and Milan.   On another note, at the FAI Conference Statutaire in October 1910, the SAI reported the gas consumed by balloons in Italy and also reported three aeroplanes in the country. ",
