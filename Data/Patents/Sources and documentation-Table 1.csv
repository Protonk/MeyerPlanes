USPTO classifications,Detailed technical category information is available by working from:  http://www.uspto.gov/web/patents/classification/uspc416/defs416.htm,
Where filed,"There are four main national patent systems where aeronautics patents were filed in this period:  Britain, France, Germany, and the U.S.  These are abbreviated br, fr, de, and us in the ""Where filed"" column.  Can include other systems when they are relevant.",
Tech field,Select all that apply:,
LTA (or balloon),LTA stands for lighter than air -- meaning balloons and dirigibles,
photog,means related to photography ; high speed photos of moving objects were relevant,
airplane,"means an apparatus with fixed wings and no balloon, designed to fly, whether a model or glider or powered glider",
propulsion,"motor power in the air -- steam or gas, internal or external combustion ; or systems driving propellers",
airfoil,"having to do with shape or orientation of an airfoil, e.g. a wing, but also experimental apparatus",
control,"control systems, e.g. a user interface of levers, handles, dials ; also the back end: ailerons, rudders, elevators",
stability,design proposals related to keeping an airplane stable in ways other than the pilot exercising control,
DE77   ,"This refers to the German patent system's class 77, meaning sport equipment, which was the usual classification for aeronautics until about 1900.  After some year, not sure which, class 77 was subdivided into 77e, 77h, etc, and ""groups"".   Andrea Maestrejuan has some documentation on this.",
navigation,"hmm, maybe this means the same thing as ""control"" ; the issue is directing the aircraft",
helicopter,systems designed to lift anything with wings/propellers that don't depend on horizontal movement,
Propeller,designs for propellers through air or water (if relevant to aeronautics by anyone's evaluation),
Kites,Related to kites ,
meteo,Relevant for meteorology,
instrument,"Tool, not part of flying machine or balloon itself ; e.g., for checking windspeed or temperature or  for inflating a balloon, or for repair purposes",
Parachute,relevant to parachutes,
Rescue,relevant to rescue purposes,
