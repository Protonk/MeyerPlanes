","By the end of 1912, Anatra, a businessman of Italian parentage and part owner of an aviation school in Odessa, had converted an Aero Club workshop into a small aircraft factory which, in June 1913, received its first order from the government.  After building French Farman, Nieuport, Morane, and Voisin aircraft for the military under license, the factory in 1915 began to produce original designs by Descampes including 2-seat tractor seaplanes and land biplanes under Anatra names including Anade, Anacler, Anasal, Anadis, and Anadva.  Production rose from 5 airplanes monthly in 1914 to 2-3 daily in mid 1917.  Khioni prototypes were built 1916-1917 but it appears not went into production.  At the end of 1917, following the Russian Revolution, the newly independent government of Ukraine took over the Odessa factory.

Nov. 1914-1922, he rejoined Bristol in 1922, beconming chief draftsman upon Barnwell's return, a position he held until 1932; between 1932 and his retirement in 1955, he held several positions including technical assistant, flight development engineer, and sales liaison engineer.  From late 1915-?,  L. G. Frise, a mechanical engineer, was Barnwell's principal assistant.  White-Smith and H. J. Thomas were made directors in 1915.

First aeroplane of own design, a Challenger pusher biplane based upon Henry Farman design (known as Bristol Box Kite) appeared in June 1910.  Also in 1910 was Challenger's school biplane.  1911 saw Challenger-Dickson biplane and two Prier monoplanes.  1912 saw two more Prier monplanes, three England military biplanes, a Coanda military monoplane, and Barnwell's conversion of an England biplane to a seaplane.  First government order was from Russia in early 1911, followed ln March 1911 by Britain; in 1912, orders came from Spain, Germany, Italy, Roumania, and Bulgaria.  Due to British military banning monoplanes in 1912, they were then sold only as exports.  1913 saw a Coanda biplane and biplane seaplane and Grandseigne racing biplane.  1914 saw two Coanda biplanes and the first Scout, a joint deisgn of Barnwell and Busteed.  1915 and 1916 saw more Scouts and Barnwell monoplane fighters.  Up to end of 1916, all aeroplanes had used wooden structural members and steel fittings; 1917 saw first all-metal aeroplane, a 2-seater reconn. biplane.

Ltd.; the assets were transferred in March 1920.  Up to 4 Aug 1914, B&C had built in all some 260 aeroplanes and its flying schools had trained more than 300 pilots.  During WW1, some 400 Scout types, known by the nickname Bullet, and some 3,500 2-seat fighters, known as the Brisfit, were built, mostly by other firms.  By end of October 1914, the Filtoin works were devoted to producing Royal Aircraft Factory BE2cs and the few Scouts on order. Barnwell joined the R.F.C. in November 1914, serving until August 1915 when he was released at the rank of captain to rejoin B&C; Barnwell was chief designer from then until his accidental death in 1938.  Tinson joined the A.D. in late 1914 and served there and at Frederick Sage and Co. until 1922 when he returned to Bristol.  In 1917, more than a 1,000 B&C aeroplanes were built; 1918 was the peak year of production when over 2,000 aeroplanes were built; but even in post-war 1919, almost 1,000 machines, mostly Britfits, were built.  After that, B&C turned to civilian production.   Dir1920 lists Filton and an office in New York City; ad p. 39 says ""Oldest aircraft constructors in Great Britain . . . workshops cover nine acres.""  After leaving B&C, Challenger went to Vickers, England free-lanced, and Coanda returned to Roumania to help its war effort.  Grandsiegne appears to have been absent in 1912, during which time he was engaged in experiments for Clement-Bayard.",Bristol 1,0402,"Gunston says George Stanley was son, not brother; still need to resolve this.  Also need to determine when Bristol ceased to operate.  Gunston says ""Bristol Aeroplane Co. Ltd."" was an ad hoc name in 1920, there having been another company registered by that name in 1910.  I don't think it makes sense to go into that on the worksheet; obviously, the name Bristol Aeroplane Co. remained as the name the company did business under.  Plus, since Gunston says the business transfered to the new name 6 Mar 1920 and my research shows that the name was taken 31 Dec 1919, it would appear issues surrounding the name were resolved by 6 Mar 1920.  Please note that I am above character limits for several of the cells in this row.  Reducing font further doesn't seem to help.

The 8-cyclinder air-cooled SAB/75 was developed for Farman aircraft but it was the next engine, the 6-cylinder water-cooled A10 of 1914, that went into wide production.  In 1914-1915, over 1,000 were installed in aircraft including Farmans, Aviatics, and Caproni trimotor bombers.  In 1915, Fiat obtained a license to build the Maurice Farman 5B aircraft itself; the first was flown at Mirafiori 7 Oct 1915.  Fiat produced the 5B with Fiat engines at two factories; output is said to have soon reached 30 per month.  At the same time, Fiat was collaborating with Italian military designers Savoia and Pomilio in developing the SP1, a Farman-derived 2-seater pusher with Fiat A12 engine.  In Dec. 1915, Savoia and Pomilio resigned the military and in Feb. 1916 formed Costruzioni Aeronautiche Ing. O. Pomilio & C. where they completed designing the SP2, an improved version of the SP1.

According to SD, despite Fokker's relocation to the Netherlands, 1919, the factory at Schwerin, renamed Schweriner Industrie-Werke, continued production of Fokker transports into the 1920s, but we believe this to be without any participation by Fokker.

Charles earned his pilot's certificate on 20 Jan. 1912; at the end of January 1913, while testing a monoplane built for the French military, both he and his mechanic Giollot were killed.

","Continued development of existing designs and by 1914 had sold over 120 aircraft, including to the French, Italian, and Russian armies.  With new designer in 1914 came updates to existng designs and the Nieuport 10, a sesquiplane biplane racer, which was ready by late 1914.  From this stemmed over 10,000 aircraft of 16 basic types, until the lineup ended in 1917 with the Nieuport 27.  From then, the company produced more conventional biplanes.  In 1920, merged with the Astra balloon/airship company to become Nieuport-Astra, though the aircraft were called Nieuport-Delage.",1920,1913FM128; wikipedia.org/wiki/Nieuport; G220-221; 2dG333; SD216.,"1920Dir23 lists Nieuport, Societe Anonyme des Establissements at Issy-les-Moulineaux.

Vendome already had his company, Raoul Vendeome et Cie, which see.  In 1908, Odier met engineer Leon Turcat of the automobile firm Turcat-Mery. who agreed to sponsor the study and construction of a prototype aircraft by Odier and Vendome and Turcat would furnish the motor.  This appears to have been the Odier-designed pusher biplane flown June 1909.  Henri Louis Rougier, a racer of bicycles, motor cars, and aircraft, and owner of the Paris agency for Turcat-Mery, became associated with Odier-Vendome in 1910 and likely sponsored the Turcat-Mery-Rougier biplane flown in June 1910 and exhibited at the Paris Flight Salon, October 1910.      ","Indicated 2dG345 that Odier flew pusher biplane 1 Jun 1909 and tractor biplane June 1910, both with same Turcat auto engine, but G309 and 2dG467 say tractor flown with ENV engine.  SD lists 1909 biplane, 1910 biplane, and 1911 monoplane, all designated Odier-Vendome.  Contemporaneous literature plus more recent information provides both corroborating and differing information.  FM, 1 May 1909, describes housed at Issy a biplane of 10 meters with a 30hp Turcat-Mery motor belonging to Odier that was built by Regy Freres (we think. perhaps. it would have been better to have said ""built at"" Regy Freres).

Photo matches one in FM, 29 Oct 1910, of Turcat-Mery-Rougier biplane exhibited at the Paris Flight Salon.  See also  photo with Rougier at wheel at 2dG346-347. According to Aircraft, Dec 1910, this, Odier's latest product, was built for engineering firm Turcat-Mery (no mention of it being built by Turcat-Mery) and was to be flown by Rougier; it's 4-bladed propeller was placed in front of the planes and it was powered by an ENV engine (thus sounding like 1910 craft listed by the Gs except for the motor).  AeronauticsUS, Aug 1910, advertised Odier-Vendome monoplane, ready to fly, for $2500 F.O.B. New York (and was thus earlier than monoplane listed in SD).  From FM, 6 Aug 1910, we learn of Odier-Vendome flying school at Issy.  According to http://patrimoine.gadz. org/gadz/odier.htm, after that Odier built flying machines with wings folded or dismantled for transport by road and easy storage for race pilots until, ca. 1912, he became chief engineer for Etablissements Borel, which see.

In November 1908, Rumpler advertised in Berlin that the aircraft company of Engineer Edmund Rumpler could execute his client's ideas for aircraft at moderate prices.  As of February 1909 he had sufficient orders to warramt incorporating his company and soon opened a site at the Berlin Johannisthal airport to design and build aircraft as well as aircraft engines.  Thereupon, he turned out a helicopter and nine monoplanes with engines that he built; all except one were unable to fly and the one that got airborne was destroyed on its first flight.  He then reached out to the aircraft designer and constructor Igo Etrich whose Tabue 2 had flown for 68 minutes in May 1910 and got manufacturing and distribution rights for Germany.   ","The first Rumpler Taubes of 1910, though Etrich 2 reproductions, failed to fly until Rumpler finaly substituted an Antionette engine for his own engines.  Thereafter, Rumpler was on his way to success.  Meanwhile, Etrich had been approached by Hellmuth Hirth about rights for Germany and since they had already been granted to Rumpler, Etrich sent Hirth to Rumpler.  Hirth then trained as a pilot at the Etrich factory under Karl Illner, returning to Rumpler in March 1911 as Rumpler's chief pilot.  Rumpler soon stopped paying licensing fees to Etrich, though to December 1912 he was still constructing the original Etrich Taube 2 or the same with only minor modifications.  Etrich apparently not only did not fight this but withdrew his patent application in Germany.  To 1914, Rumpler produced about 200 Taubes of various types, though none significantly different from the original, as well as producing fuselages, landing gear, and such.  After that, he produced aircraft for the Germany military, primarily biplanes, including reconnaissances and bombers, presumbably stopping by Armistice.

Patented in 1898, the ""Consuta"" system, based on Saunders' study of Candian-Indian birchbark canoes, consisted of sewing together veneers of plywood laid in different directions, with layers of waterproofed fabric between, to make a complete skin.  ","The first heavier-than-air aircraft project, probably begun in 1910, was building a hydro-aeroplane--apparently owned by and perhaps designed by Henri Fabre--for Roger Ravaud; during trials in March 1911, it made a few hops ranging up to 500 meters but, caught by the wind, it was blown onto the rocks and wrecked.  The next aircraft project was in 1912 when Saunders built a double-skinned hollow hull using its ""Consuta"" system for a Sopwith amphibian ""bat boat;"" weighing only 180 lbs, it was wide enough to seat pilot and passenger side by side; this craft won the Mortimer-Singer prize in 1913 for its ability to make a series of landings and take-offs from both water and land.

","In 1909, his sister Olga Sikorsky funded his purchase in France of an Anzani 25-horsepower engine, the same engine used by Bleriot in his epic flight across the English channel in July of that year. Notes from SY: In 1899 at the age of 10, built a spring-driven model of a helicopter. The Imperial Grand Duke Alexander,upon returning from France in 1910, encouraged the founding of the Imperial All-Russian Aero Club (the Aero Club lasted until 1917) and in 1911 Sikorsky earned pilot's license No. 64. Meanwhile, in 1910, after two unsuccessful attempts to build a helicopter, Sikorsky launched his ""S"" series of aircraft, which included both monoplanes and biplanes. The S-1, with a modest 15-hp engine, did not actually fly but served as a test bed for perfecting longitudinal and directional control during high-speed ground runs. His actual breakthrough came in the spring of 1911 with the flyable S-5, powered by an Argus 50-hp engine that allowed him to make short cross-country flights at altitudes of up to 1,500 feet. In 1912, moved to St. Petersburg to head a new aviation branch factory of the Russo-Baltic Wagon Company. In 1899 at the age of 10, Sikorsky built a spring-driven model of a helicopter. In 1909, his sister Olga funded his purchase in France of an Anzani 25-h.p. engine.  Between early May 1909 and mid-December 1910, Sikorsky constructed a helicopter with the 25-h.p. engine that failed to fly; two air-driven sleighs that glided on snow; a helicopter powered with a new 25-h.p. Anzani engine that lifted but could not carry the weight of an operator; the S-1 pusher biplane that lifted but whose 15 h.p. Anzani motor did not provide enough power for it to fly; the S-2 pusher biplane powered by the second 25 h.p. Anzani motor, which made several flights of under 60 seconds each, but eventually was destroyed in a crash landing; and the S-3, powered by a 40-h.p. Anzani engine, whose career consisted of 13 flights and about seven minutes of air time in a little over a week before being damaged in a hard landing. In April 1911, tests began on both the S-4, which was an improvement on the S-3, and the S-5, which had a 50-h.p. water-cooled Argus motor, a larger wing area, and different control arrangements.  On 17 May 1911, Sikorsky flew the S-5 for about four minutes on a pre-determined course, returning close to the point of departure, and by mid-summer he was able to stay in the air for a half hour at 1,000 feet of altitutde.  He then went on to build the S-6 that, disassembled and rebuilt, became the S-6-A, which by early 1912, at a speed of 113 km. per hour (about 70 miles per hour), had exceeded the world record of speed for a plane with a pilot and two passengers.  In February 1912, the S-6-A received the highest award in the Moscow aircraft exhibition.  Meanwhile, in the fall of 1911, he earned F.A.I. pilot license No. 64 from the Imperial All-Russian Aero Club, which had been founded in 1910 by The Imperial Grand Duke Alexander. (Note: the Aero Club lasted until 1917). In the spring of 1912, Sikorsky sold his design rights on the S-6-A and all other designs and inventions in aviation that he had or would have in the next five years to come to the Russian-Baltic Railroad Car Factory and accepted a position with them as designer and chief engineer of an aircraft subsidiary that he would establish in St. Petersburg.  Additional Note 1:  While known later in the United States as a builder of helicopters, Sikorsky built no helicopters in the period between 1910 and 1939, when his U.S. factory produced its first helicopter. Additional Note 2: IS10. Before the 1917 Revolution, Russia followed the Julian calendar, which in the 20th Century, was 13 days behind the Gregorian or Western calendar. Dates in IS have been converted to the Gregorian calendar. It would appear from one instance in 1913 when a date in WS was 13 days earlier than a date in IS, that for exact dates above, WS used Gregorian dates.Codes for sources specific to Sikorsky:[[IS]] = K.N.

In 1912, which was prior its manufacturing, operated a flying school using Deperdussin monoplanes.  In 1915, it opened a flying-boat school; also, in 1915, it had a team of exhibition aviators.  At various times, it professed to represent the Charavay propeller, Deperdussin aeroplanes, the Smith Tachometer, and Anazani and Le Rhone in the U.S.  On 12 May 1916, Sloane Aeroplane Co. was taken over involuntarily by the newly-formed Standard Aero Corp., which had possession of a majority of Sloane Aeroplane Co.'s shares, and Sloane's assets became the nucleus of Standard Aero Corp.

Sloane alleged that Mitsui, rather than waiting to be repaid from the profits of this venture, transferred Sloane's stock shares to Standard Aero Corp., which then stripped the Sloane Co. of its assets and business.

O. M. (Thomas Octave Murdoch) Sopwith; learned to fly a balloon at age 18; by age 22 (1910), had taught himself to fly an airplane, earning Britain's 31st aviator certificate; raised money for his airplane manufacturing company by stunt flying.  SD says formed late 1911 but other sources seen say 1912. Company began as Sopwith Aviation School at Brooklands and, lacking sufficient space at Brooklands for aircraft construction, rented skating rink on Richmond Road, Kingston-on-Thames, in December 1912.  Until business grew, Sopwith rented rink to skaters on Saturdays and towed aircraft on their own wheels to Brooklands for assembly and testing or to the Thames River in the case of seaplanes.  With him at the beginning were engineer Fred Sigrist, who became works manager, and pilot Harry George Hawker (both Australians); R.J. Ashfield was hired as draftsman.   In December 1913, Sopwith Aviation Co. Ltd. registered the business formerly carried on by Sopwith Aviation Co.; first directors were Sopwith, Miss Gertrude M. Sopwith, and Reginald O. Cary. ","Sopwith Aviation Co. built numerous biplanes, mostly if not all of the tractor type, and even a triplane, but did not build a monoplane until 1918 when two proto- types were built.  Gunston calls the Bat Boat flying boat, introduced early 1913, the first Sopworth of distinction, while Flight Magazine, 1919, called the Tabloid 2-seater, introduced later in 1913 and notable for having more lateral control and speed than thought possible in a biplane, the ""beginning of the greatness of the House of Sopwith.""  Most remembered, however, are its wartime aircraft, particularly the 1 1/2 Strutter bomber and fighters, dating from late 1915, the first British aircraft to carry a synchronized gun firing through the propeller, and the Sopwith Camel land and sea fighters, dating from late 1916, the first to carry two machine guns.  Some 6,000 Camels and more than 10,000 other Sopwith military planes were built in WWI either by Sopwith or contractors.  While it tried to continue building aircraft postwar, it also diversified, adding the manufacture of A.B.C. motorcycles.

In Nov 1914, Herbert Smith was put in charge of new design, apparently becoming de facto Sopwith's first chief designer.  In early 1919, keeping its works at Kingston-on-Thames, the firm acquired offices and showrooms in London and changed its name to Sopwith Aviation and Engineering Co. Ltd.  It built a small twin-float tractor biplane that entered the Schneider Cup Race on 10 Sept 1919.  Whether due to business slow down, a large claim from the British Treasury for excess war profits duty, losses on the motorcycle side, or a combination thereof, the firm voluntarily liquidated in Sept 1920.  In Nov 1920, Sopwith, Sigrist, and Hawker registered a new company, H. G. Hawker Engineering Co. Ltd., which purchased the Sopwith company patents and took over the old works at Kingston-on-Thames. Smith went to Japan to design for Mitsubishi; Hawker died, 1921.     ",Sopwith,,"Do I need to keep this:  Sopwith have agents in Melbourne Australia (Dir1920, p13)?

According to SD, in 1919, Bleriot merged the SPAD establishment into Bleriot Aeronautique, although designs originating with the SPAD staff continued to receive SPAD designations well into the 1930s.  According to G and 2dG, however, it was not until 1921 that the company was restructured and renamed Bleriot Aeronautique.  Future research should enable us to determine the correct date and to verify the name of the restructured firm.  1920Dir40 lists a works called Air Navigation and Engineering Co, Ltd. as having an address at Bleriot and Spad Aircraft Works, Addlestone, Surrey, UK.

Wittemann and Adolph D. Wittemann were granted a US patent 28 Oct 1913 (application date 1910 Apr 18) for a flying machine.  Adolph .reportedly left the company in 1914 but the C. and A. Witteman company name stayed until Wittemann-Lewis Aircraft Co. was formed, apparently in late 1916 but possibly the date is late 1915.  Either by then or after Wittemann-Lewis Aircraft Co. was formed, the C. and A. Wittemann plant closed.

In 1919, built a manufacturing plant on swampy meadows below Hasbrouck Heights, Bergen County, NJ (the land was either purchased then or in 1918; it is now the site of the Teterboro Airport).   ",1,"C. and A. Wittemann Aeronautical Engineeers reformed as Wittemann-Lewis Aircraft Co., apparently either late 1915 or late 1916.  The named principals were Charles R. Wittemann, president, and aviator Samuel C. Lewis, vice president; Redmond F. Kernan was secretary, Paul W. Wittemann, treasurer; brothers Walter and were also involved.  (Lewis had previously been a civilian instructor in France for officers of the French Flying Corps.)  The actual incorporation in New Jersey appears to have followed a 16 Oct 1916 meeting with representatives of the U.S. Army Signal Corps.  Apprently on the basis of that meeting, Wittemann-Lewis formed, acquired a large building on the north edge of Newark Meadows (where Newark Airport is now located), converted it to an aircraft factory, and designed and built a prototype training airplane to Signal Corps specifications, all in anticipation of an order to follow.  In 1919, A. Francis Arcier, who had been chief engineer of Handley-Page, emigrated to the US and joined Wittemann-Lewis as its designer and chief engineer.    ","A tractor trainng biplane with Hall-Scott 90hp motor, built to US Army Signal Corps specifications, was ready on 16 Apr 1917; it was then flown from the factory to the Signal Corps training school at Mineola, Long Island.  However, despite earlier promises from the Signal Corps, a contract was not forthcoming.  It appears that in 1919, they did receive a contract from the US Post Office to convert surplus US Army DH4s.  In 1919, apparently for that work, they built a manufacturing plant on swampy meadows they had bought near Hasbrouck Heights, NJ, (the date of the land purchase is not clear) and in 1920 converted 75-100 aircraft to be used for the first airmail service.  Also in 1919, Arcier joined fhe firm and started designing the biplanes that carried his initials FA as their designation; by January 1920 he was up to FA4. eventually the series went to FA10 and included both land and sea aircraft.  In 1920, Lewis left the firm and on 1 Feb. 1921 the Wittemann Aircraft Corp., a Delaware corporation, succeeded the Wittemann-Lewis Corp.

We are unclear about whether the Barling Bonber, a 3-winged, 10-wheeled, 6-engined bomber, was designed for the U.S. Army by Walter H. Barling when the company was still Wittemann-Lewis or after it became Wittemann Aircraft.  The contract to built it went to Wittemann Aircraft.  Problems with payments from the government, apparently on this as well as on other contracts, eventually forced Wittemann Aircraft out of business and either in late 1923 or early 1924, it leased its plant to Atlantic Aircraft Corp., the US subsidiary of Fokker, and filed a petition in bankruptcy; Atlantic later purchased these assets.  SD appears to date Wittemann-Lewis as beginning 1914 and has Lewis leaving in 1917.  However, we are relying on our source, a reported legal decision (see 144NER673), that Wittemann-Lewis was formed in 1921 and so far we can document that Lewis was part of the firm in 1918.  A recent history of Teterboro Airport states the Lewis left the company in 1920.  While we think 1920 is correct, as several other dates in this book re the Wittemann companies are in conflict with each other, we are looking for another source to document when Lewis left.  Note that G and 2dG date Wittemann-Lewis from 1919-1923 and thus has not only its beginning and ending dates wrong but misses its succession by Wittemann Aircraft.  Also, note that in ""Wittemann Aircraft,"" ""Wittemann"" is often spelled without the final ""n.""   According to the 19 Jul 1923 NYT, Walter H. Barling designed the Barling Bomber, which makes sense; however AAFFA attributes it to Arcier, which we think a mistake.  ",Wittemann 3,0508,"General Notes is now too long.

A ""peculiar"" WLD biplane appears to have first been seen in public in September 1908.  It had four main surfaces, stair-stepped one behind the other, so that the last was situated immediately above a pair of vertical rudders at the rear of the frame.  Each plane was bent in the middle so as to form a flat inverted V and the foremost main plane had a pair of supplementary planes beneath it, which would make it a biplane in name although these lower supplemental planes were quite small in surface compared to what was above them; lifting surfaces were 47 square meters in area, the engine was a 50hp Renault, and the wooden propeller, 3 meters in diameter, was situated behind.  In a photograph printed in early Febrruary 1909, and identified as an earlier view (of what is not known), the three lower main planes were about 1/3 the size of the forward main plane and all surfaces appeared flat except for the forward main plane, . . .

In late April 1909, there appears to have been a different WLD machine, this one using two main planes and a 50hp Renault motor.  A Witzig biplane, referred to as having undergone considerable alteations, was flown 250 meters on 28 July 1909 and what was identified as Biplane 2 was tested at Issy on at least two days in August 1909.  Whatever was at Issy was under water in its hangar from the floods in early 1910 and we have so far not found any subsequent reports.
